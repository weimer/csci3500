<h1>Overview</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    Does your brain treat writing a program more like writing a poem or more like solving an equation? 
  </li>
  <li>
   What does the psychology of perception say about user interface design?
  </li>
  <li>
    Does balancing a pen on your finger show the same patterns of neural activity as balancing a tree data structure? 
  </li>
  <li>
    How do cognitive biases influence code review? 
  </li>
   <li>
      What do professional programmers think about the benefits and drawbacks of substances like Adderall or cannabis?     
   </li>
  <li>
  What does the psychology of trust teach us about human decisions to deploy tools?  
  </li>
</ul>  
  
<p>
This seminar course covers the intersection of software topics (e.g., reading, writing and debugging programs) and human factors (e.g., perception, bias, cognition). It will involve an exploration of classic topics in psychology (e.g., Asch's conformity experiment, zero-risk bias, functional magnetic resonance imaging, mental rotation, Hick's law, etc.) in a manner that is approachable to students without prior psychology experience. We will relate these topics to activities in computer science and we will discuss the resulting implications on both academic and industrial practice. Students will be graded on in-class discussions and short presentations on the material. Group discussions will focus on constructive conversations that summarize the work, analyze its strengths, and brainstorm ways in which it might be improved in the future. 
</p> 
  
<p>
Special emphasis will be placed on instructor-led in-person discussions
of contextual aspects of papers that may be less evident to students (e.g.,
based on the instructor's first-hand knowledge of the authors or research
situation). These may include:
  <ul>
    <li> The impact or influence the paper had on subsequent work</li> 
    <li> Whether some aspects of the paper were accidental or planned</li> 
    <li> Why certain reasonable-seeming approaches were not taken</li>  
    <li> How difficult certain types of the work were to carry out</li> 
  </ul> 
</p> 
<p>
Such discussions can help students to view papers as part of a
collaborative, human activity takes place over a span of time.
Conversations about how to construct well-designed follow-on work (e.g.,
balancing risk and rewarding, lifting input assumptions, etc.), at the
level of the graduate Preliminary Exam, will be encouraged.
</p> 

<h1>Software Engineering and Cognition</h1>
<p>
This class will include papers that explicitly cover human cognitive
aspects of software engineering and programming languages, such as studies
that make use of eye tracking or medical imaging. 
</p> 
<p>
It is <b>not</b> expected that incoming students have any expertise in such
cognitive aspects. Instead, relevant cognitive aspects will be discussed
(including in the third paper, below) such that students can interpret
their relevance to computer science. 
</p> 

<h1>Structure and Presentations</h1>

<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Randomized Presentations</h3>    
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
For each paper discussion I will choose up to three students <i>at
random</i> to give a five-minute presentation. 
  </div>
</div> 
<p>
Each selected student will give a five-minute in-person presentation that
at least (1) summarizes the work, (2) lists its strengths, and (3) lists
ways in which it might be improved in a subsequent publication. Including
other information, such as your opinion about the work or its relation to
other projects, is recommended. 
</p>

<p>
The goals of this randomized approach are to encourage all participants to
read the material thoroughly in advance, to provide jumping-off points for
detailed discussions, and to allow me to evaluate participation.
</p>

<p>
There is no project component to this course &mdash; your primary
responsibility is to prepare five minutes of cogent discussion for each
paper. 
</p> 

<h1>Grading Rubric</h1>

<p>
Grading will be based on in-person participation. 
</p> 

<div class="container">
      <div class="row row-centered">
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-centered col-min">

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">40%</span> Paper Presentations
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">40%</span> Discussions
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">20%</span> Professionalism
  </li>
</ul> 
</div></div></div> 
</p> 

<p>
In more detail, <i>Paper Presentations</i> will be graded on the summarization
of the work (20%), the enumeration of strengths (30%), and areas and
mechanisms for improvement (50%). 
  <ul>
  <li> While paper summarizations are common in many settings, this course
  places a particular emphasis on identifying areas for improvement that
  may not be mentioned by the authors of a work. For example, a paper may
  present an analysis that only works on single-threaded programs, but the
  paper may not call out this weakness explicitly. Instead, readers may
  note that all of the benchmarks were single-threaded and that the analysis
  relies on the values of variables remaining constant. Readers might
  identify this area for improvement and also identify a potential
  mechanism for overcoming it (e.g., perhaps the analysis could be
  augmented with manual annotations about which variables are modified by
  other threads, or perhaps a dynamic lockset approach like Eraser could be
  used to provide missing information, etc.). 
  </li>
  <li> This identification of paper areas for improvement that are not
  explicit but are instead implicit (in the "negative space" of the paper,
  as it were) is an important skill, and one that we will practice
  together. Similarly, we will work together on identifying how to bring
  together topics and ideas from computer science to address such
  weaknesses. 
  </li> 
  </ul> 
</p> 

<P>
The <i>Discussion</i> component will be assessed by noting when
students contribute to the conversation and analysis of a
paper (outside of their presentations). 
  <ul>
    <li> Student contributions will be noted on a three-point scale, with
    two points for a typical discussion element, three points for a
    more insightful analysis, and one point for a less fruitful
    interjection. </li> 
    <li> Discussion points are graded on insight and relevant, rather than
    on length. A theme of the course is that sometimes a single sentence or
    observation can significantly influence how a paper is interpreted. The
    focus is not on long-winded reiterations of the main paper points, but
    on identifying "interactions" (e.g., "given that they mention in
    Section 3 that they are recruiting only students, their use of this
    industrial task in Section 5 may not be indicative ...", etc.) or
    areas for improvement. </li> 
    <li> Particularly insightful contributions will be described as such
    by the instructor (e.g., to help students who may not be as familiar
    with this sort of course to identify the desired approach). </li> 

    <li> Each student can earn at most three points per class meeting. This
    is to prevent one student from dominating a discussion while also
    encouraging students to speak multiple times per meeting. </li> 
    <li> If there are <i>N</i> course meetings, full discussion credit
    corresponds to <i>N</i> earned points, distributed in any manner. </li> 
    <li> Students can make up the discussion component in Office Hours, 
    earning up to three points per session. </li> 

    <li> The relative simplicity of discussion grading (informally:
    check-plus, check, check-minus) also helps the professor track 
    it without interrupting the flow of the conversation. </li> 
  </ul> 
</p> 

<p>
The <i>Professionalism</i> component will be assessed in terms of helping
to maintain a welcoming environment for everyone and demonstrating our
shared values. Participants are assumed to be professionals by default, but
may lose points in certain negative circumstances. Examples of
less-professional conduct include:  
  <ul>
  <li> Rudely interrupting or speaking over someone else. Instead, we favor
  giving speakers time to complete their thoughts. (The professor will
  gently move along any stalled or overly-verbose discussion.) 
  </li> 
  <li> Suggesting that the quality of a particular paper or statement is in
  any way related to the demographics of its authors. Instead, we assess
  papers on the merits of their presented ideas and evidence.
  </li> 
  <li> Intentionally using defamatory or belittling phrasing to describe
  people or groups. Some of the papers we will read and discuss tackle
  practitioner biases or expertise differences. We want to factually
  discuss such biases, with a goal of mitigating, rather than perpetuating,
  those concerns. </li> 

  </ul> 
</p> 

<p>
Informally, one sufficient
condition for an "A" grade is to do a good job whenever you are called on
to present a paper, to interject insightful comments into the
discussions of other papers, and to treat others respectfully. 
</p> 

<p>
The grading cutoffs are: 
  <ul>
    <li> 70% = C- </li> 
    <li> 73% = C  </li> 
    <li> 77% = C+ </li> 
    <li> 80% = B- </li> 
    <li> 83% = B  </li> 
    <li> 87% = B+ </li> 
    <li> 90% = A- </li> 
    <li> 93% = A  </li> 
    <li> 98% = A+ </li> 
  </ul> 
</p> 


<h1>First Class Meeting</h1>

<p>
The first meeting will take place on Tuesday, January 23rd.
You are responsible for reading the <i>first two papers</i> in advance.
</p> 

<p>
However, I will get the discussion rolling for Paper #1 ("Producing wrong
data ..."), so you do not need to prepare a presentation for it. The
discussion for it will probably be short. 
</p> 

<p>
I will begin randomly calling on students when we advance to Paper #2. 
You should prepare your five minute discussions for that paper. 
</p> 

<h1>Reading List</h1> 
<a name="readings"></a> 

<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title">Read Two Ahead</h3>
        </div>
          <div class="panel-body">
You are responsible for reading and preparing for the next
two not-yet-discussed papers for any given class meeting. 
                </div>
                </div>

<p>
On average, we will discuss three papers a week (devoting perhaps 50
minutes to each paper). However, some papers may merit more or less
discussion. 
</p>

<p>
It is often possible to find presentation slides or video recordings
associated with a paper. You are welcome to use those as part of your
preparation. 
</p> 

<p>
The next paper to discuss may be shown below a highlighted line. You should
read and prepare at least the next two-to-three papers before the next
meeting.
